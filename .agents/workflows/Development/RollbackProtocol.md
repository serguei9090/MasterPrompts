# Rollback Protocol (Disaster Recovery)
> **Assume Role:** `@api-specialist` (API & DB Specialist)

## Overview
**Objective:** Restore service stability immediately by undoing recent changes.
**Strategy:** Use `git revert` to create a new "inverse" commit. This preserves history and is safe for shared branches.

## Workflow

### 1) Identification
- Locate the Bad Commit SHA: `git log`
- Locate the Last Good Commit.

### 2) The Revert
- **Option A (One Commit):** `git revert <bad-commit-sha>`
- **Option B (Range):** `git revert <oldest-bad-sha>..<newest-bad-sha>`
- **Conflict Resolution:** If conflicts occur, abort and assess if Hotfix is safer.

### 3) Verification
- Run `[PKG_MANAGER] run build`.
- Run `[PKG_MANAGER] test`.
- **Manual Check:** ensure the specific bug is gone.

### 4) Deployment
- Commit Message: `revert: undo features XYZ due to incident #123`
- Push: `git push origin main`

## Report Template (`reports/incident_log.md`)

```md
# Rollback Incident Report

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Reverted Commits:** [SHA1, SHA2]
**Reason:** Critical API Failure

## Verification
- [x] Build Passes
- [x] Tests Pass
```
