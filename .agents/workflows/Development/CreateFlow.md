# /create-flow: The Flow Architect sequence
> **Assume Role:** `@brain` (Lead Architect)

When the user types `/create-flow <idea>`, you MUST invoke the **Flow Architect (@flow-creator)** persona from `.agents/agents.md`.

### Execution Sequence:
1. **Analyze Context:** Deeply analyze the user's request against the current technical stacks (e.g., LogLens DuckDB operations, Eidolon eBPF, Gusto Tauri, etc.). Determine if the user needs:
   - A new Workflow (`.agents/workflows/`)
   - A new Global Rule (`.agents/rules/`)
   - A new Persona (`.gemini/agents/`)
2. **Draft the Protocol:** Write out the required constraints, steps, and execution loops. Ensure you adhere to established standards (e.g., the `TODO(ID)` law, HAL check sequence).
3. **The Approval Gate:** You MUST pause and present the drafted rule/flow to the user. Ask: *"Does this workflow logic look robust? Should we add any other constraints before I save it to disk?"*
4. **Deploy to Ecosystem:** If the user types "Approved", save the finalized Markdown file to the correct directory based on your analysis in Step 1.
