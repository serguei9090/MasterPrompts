# Universal Git Snapshot Protocol
> **Assume Role:** `@brain` (Lead Architect)

Use this workflow to safely stage and commit changes at any time. This avoids massive "end of day" monolithic commits by binding every change to a specific `TODO(ID)`.

## Execution Steps

**1. Verification (Turbo-Run Optional)**
Ensure all files are saved. If you are an AI, confirm you have completed the requested changes.

**2. Status Check**
// turbo
`git status`

**3. Stage and Commit**
The commit message MUST follow the format: `type(TODO_ID): message`
Types include: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`.

Example Command for AI execution:
// turbo
`git add . && git commit -m "feat(init_001): scaffolded base project structure"`

## Guidelines for AI Execution
- **Atomic Commits**: DO NOT bundle completely unrelated changes (like modifying the python sidecar and the react UI concurrently without separate commits).
- **Mandatory ID**: You must include the `TODO(ID)` in the commit message bracket. If there is no specific ID, use `(global)`.
- **Pre-execution**: Before executing step 3, prompt the user with the proposed commit message if you are unsure of the scope.
